# Final Project -> Creating a Java Server
- we're creating a Java server with the [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) framework using Maven
- you're gonna be working collaboratively now 
	- make sure to communicate with each other what you're doing
	- work on seperate branches
	- perform a pull request to other people's branches to merge all of your changes

# TODO (Nov 14th)
- [ ] install and run Java, Maven and Micronaut on your systems
	- if you wish to run it on the linux server ask me, ill download it to the server
- [ ] add the following get requests to the server
	- [ ] `get /`
		- returns "api is operational!"
	- [ ] `get /get`
		- [ ] takes in the following parameters:
			- [ ] `name`
			- [ ] `cohort`
			- [ ] `team`
		- [ ] stores all of the paramters in a string array 
- [ ] when done, do a pull request to the main branch and let me know (i have to approve it)
